The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini.\n\n---\n---\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.\n\nThe best iPad (2021) deals\n\nAnnounced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.\n\nThe last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Amazon and Walmart are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi starting at $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, third-party seller Adorama is selling it at Amazon in select colors for $408.99 (about $70 off).\n\n\"A last-gen model is still worth considering\"\n\nThe last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.\n\n[Product: 2021 iPad (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-256GB/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F483978365, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91TLNJ?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\n\nAlthough the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $279 ($70 off), which is $30 more than the all-time low. Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $429 ($70 off), which is about $20 more than its best price to date. \n\n[Product: 2022 Apple iPad (64GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnhiF7MuWJX?u1=vergebfsales2024, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1485722187%2F]\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\n\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades.\n\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\n\nRight now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at Amazon and Walmart for $479 ($20 off), which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage at Amazon and Walmart starting at $577 ($22 off), which is $17 more than its lowest price to date.\n\n[Product: 2024 iPad Mini (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YF38G?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2024-Apple-iPad-mini-A17-Pro-chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue%2F13288603065, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\n\nThe 2024 iPad Air doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.\n\nDeals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Amazon and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off).\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J617D7?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnoZwP6sCHN, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-11-inch-m2-2024-6th-generation-wi-fi-128gb-purple%2F-%2FA-85966277]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J59856?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmTsD4zsbQK, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-2024-1st-generation-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray%2F-%2FA-85966244]\n\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nCompared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\n\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $899 ($100 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,099 ($200 off), which is an all-time low price.\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgvZ8KY6XY, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966229]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgv2kx7lHb, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966373]\n"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"ItemList","itemListOrder":"ItemListUnordered","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@type":"Product","name":"2021 iPad (Wi-Fi)","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24489390/236563_Apple_iPad_9th_gen_DSeifert_0002.jpg","description":"Apple’s entry-level iPad from 2021 has a 10.2-inch screen, an A13 Bionic chip, and a 12MP front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature.

The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest <a href="/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook">M4 chip</a>, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--recirculation--related-list mb-40"><h3 class="mb-16 font-polysans-mono text-14 font-medium leading-120 -tracking-1 text-blurple after:pl-8 after:content-[&#x27;/&#x27;]">Related</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-18 font-polysans text-16 font-medium leading-110 marker:text-franklin"><li class="mb-16 pl-12"><a class="hover:shadow-underline-black" href="/24183158/final-cut-pro-for-ipad-2-final-cut-camera-review">The new Final Cut Pro hooked me on iPad video editing</a></li><li class="mb-16 pl-12"><a class="hover:shadow-underline-black" href="/2024/12/15/24321659/apple-foldable-18-8-inch-ipad-invisible-crease-rumor">Apple’s foldable iPad could be like ‘two iPad Pros side-by-side’</a></li><li class="mb-16 pl-12"><a class="hover:shadow-underline-black" href="/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals">Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cmgvZ8KY6XY">Best Buy</a> for $899 ($100 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date.

The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini.\n\n---\n---\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.\n\nThe best iPad (2021) deals\n\nAnnounced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.\n\nThe last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Amazon and Walmart are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi starting at $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, third-party seller Adorama is selling it at Amazon in select colors for $408.99 (about $70 off).\n\n\"A last-gen model is still worth considering\"\n\nThe last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.\n\n[Product: 2021 iPad (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-256GB/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F483978365, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91TLNJ?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\n\nAlthough the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $279 ($70 off), which is $30 more than the all-time low. Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $429 ($70 off), which is about $20 more than its best price to date. \n\n[Product: 2022 Apple iPad (64GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnhiF7MuWJX?u1=vergebfsales2024, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1485722187%2F]\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\n\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades.\n\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\n\nRight now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at Amazon and Walmart for $479 ($20 off), which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage at Amazon and Walmart starting at $577 ($22 off), which is $17 more than its lowest price to date.\n\n[Product: 2024 iPad Mini (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YF38G?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2024-Apple-iPad-mini-A17-Pro-chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue%2F13288603065, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\n\nThe 2024 iPad Air doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.\n\nDeals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Amazon and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off).\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J617D7?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnoZwP6sCHN, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-11-inch-m2-2024-6th-generation-wi-fi-128gb-purple%2F-%2FA-85966277]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J59856?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmTsD4zsbQK, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-2024-1st-generation-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray%2F-%2FA-85966244]\n\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nCompared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\n\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $899 ($100 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,099 ($200 off), which is an all-time low price.\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgvZ8KY6XY, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966229]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgv2kx7lHb, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966373]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"ItemList","itemListOrder":"ItemListUnordered","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@type":"Product","name":"2021 iPad (Wi-Fi)","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24489390/236563_Apple_iPad_9th_gen_DSeifert_0002.jpg","description":"Apple’s entry-level iPad from 2021 has a 10.2-inch screen, an A13 Bionic chip, and a 12MP front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature.

The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini.\n\n---\n---\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.\n\nThe best iPad (2021) deals\n\nAnnounced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.\n\nThe last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Amazon and Walmart are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi starting at $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, third-party seller Adorama is selling it at Amazon in select colors for $408.99 (about $70 off).\n\n\"A last-gen model is still worth considering\"\n\nThe last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.\n\n[Product: 2021 iPad (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-256GB/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F483978365, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91TLNJ?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\n\nAlthough the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $279 ($70 off), which is $30 more than the all-time low. Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $429 ($70 off), which is about $20 more than its best price to date. \n\n[Product: 2022 Apple iPad (64GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnhiF7MuWJX?u1=vergebfsales2024, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1485722187%2F]\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\n\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades.\n\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\n\nRight now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at Amazon and Walmart for $479 ($20 off), which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage at Amazon and Walmart starting at $577 ($22 off), which is $17 more than its lowest price to date.\n\n[Product: 2024 iPad Mini (Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YF38G?tag=theverge02-20, https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2024-Apple-iPad-mini-A17-Pro-chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue%2F13288603065, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S?tag=theverge02-20]\n\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\n\nThe 2024 iPad Air doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.\n\nDeals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Amazon and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off).\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J617D7?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cnoZwP6sCHN, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-11-inch-m2-2024-6th-generation-wi-fi-128gb-purple%2F-%2FA-85966277]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Air M2 (128GB, Wi-Fi) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J59856?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmTsD4zsbQK, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-13-inch-m2-2024-1st-generation-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray%2F-%2FA-85966244]\n\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nCompared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\n\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $899 ($100 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,099 ($200 off), which is an all-time low price.\n\n[Product: 11-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgvZ8KY6XY, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966229]\n\n[Product: 13-inch iPad Pro M4 (Wi-Fi, 256GB) | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/?tag=theverge02-20, https://howl.me/cmgv2kx7lHb, https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-m4-wifi-standard-glass%2F-%2FA-93870488%3Fpreselect%3D85966373]\n","stream":null,"visibleNetworkIds":[],"scheduledForExpirationAt":null}}}]},"uid":"Entry:1017dcbe-1ded-43bb-8f6d-71207675d174","mostPopular":[{"author":{"fullName":"Lauren Feiner"},"publishDate":"2025-01-02T20:53:10","title":"Net neutrality eviscerated by appeals court ruling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334309/net-neutrality-struck-down-sixth-circuit-chevron-deference","uid":"0"},{"author":{"fullName":"Adi Robertson"},"publishDate":"2025-01-02T18:40:05","title":"Apple will pay $95 million to people who were spied on by Siri","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334268/apple-siri-recording-privacy-lawsuit-settlement-proposed","uid":"1"},{"author":{"fullName":"Justine Calma"},"publishDate":"2025-01-02T19:59:31","title":"The US government announced a ‘historic’ nuclear energy deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334195/nuclear-energy-deal-us-government-constellation-gsa","uid":"2"},{"author":{"fullName":"Tom Warren"},"publishDate":"2025-01-02T17:30:00","title":"Microsoft’s mini AI PCs are on the way","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334251/microsoft-copilot-plus-mini-pcs-ces-2025-notepad","uid":"3"},{"author":{"fullName":"Jennifer Pattison Tuohy"},"publishDate":"2025-01-02T16:45:00","title":"Matter speakers are coming to stream music and tell you when the wash is done","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24332848/speakers-matter-smart-home-apple-google-amazon-legato","uid":"4"}],"hasEditorialSponsorship":false,"navProps":{"campaignGroup":null,"stickyNav":true,"logoColor":"franklin","lightText":false}},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/entry/standard/[uid]","query":{"uid":"Entry:1017dcbe-1ded-43bb-8f6d-71207675d174"},"buildId":"q7YSaPgfnMkQQdwmQOc7X","isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[{"src":"https://theverge.coral.coralproject.net/assets/js/count.js?v=0","strategy":"lazyOnload","className":"coral-script","defer":true}]}</script></body></html>

* Bump ruff and use consistent version in CI.

* Backend implementation of cookie auth.

* Factor out redundant maybe user creating.

Prevents redundant redirect.

* Expose cookie auth config to frontend.

* Refactor of frontend auth, implement cookie authentication.

* Header and password auth support.
* Consistent typing for useAuth().
* Comment to document useAPI() hook.
* Factor out auth types, config, state, settings, session and token management.
* Determine auth state based on whether user is set.
* Make auth a core component module.
* Check `/login/` response for expected output.
* Request `/user` when cookieAuth's available.
* Use `user` instead of `access_token` to determine whether we're logged in.

* Improved API error handling in frontend.

* Don't assume errors are always JSON with .detail
* Add status to ClientError.
* Factor out request error handling.
* Consistent handling of errors: either call on401() or throw, never both.
* Disable/override on4041 and onError hooks for useApi().
  Requests not initiated by the user should not cause user-facing notifications.
  Plus, 401 on `/user` is now expected behaviour.

* Move onErrorRetry logic to useAPI(), prevents infinite recursion.

* Cleanup, improvement and cookie auth tests in password_* tests.

* Separate assertions and state preparation.
* Check for call on /user for cookie auth.
* Test for presence of cookie in login reply.

* Re-enable user validation for `get_file()`. Closes #1101.
